    <div class="text-block-18"><br> Effective Date: 5 November 2020<br> <br>HOMA GAMES SAS (collectively,
      “<strong>Homa</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”) provides this
      Privacy Policy (this “<strong>Policy</strong>”) to describe the types of information we collect on our website -
      <a href="http://homagames.com/" target="_blank" class="link">http://homagames.com/</a> (the
      “<strong>Website</strong>”) and through any games or mobile applications published by Homa (the
      “<strong>Apps</strong>”), and how we collect, process, store, use, and manage these information, including
      personal information, and data from users of the Website and the Games (“<strong>Users</strong>”,
      “<strong>your</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”).<br> <br>Hereinafter, we refer to both the Apps and the Website
      as the “<strong>Services</strong>”.<br> <br>In providing the Services, Homa Games acts as data controller, as
      defined in European Regulation n°2016/679, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation (the
      “<strong>GDPR</strong>”).<br> <br>Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information and data
      collected or received by Homa through your use of the Services. Homa is not responsible for the actions of
      individuals with no relationship to Homa or third-party companies. Links to those websites available on the
      Website do not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those individuals or companies.<br>

      browser settings, the installed plug-ins, the time zone, the screen size of your device, unique device ID,
      Advertising ID*, Device Identifier**, the type and version of your operating system (“OS”), and your general
      (city/country) location (based on your IP address);<br> <br>- Gameplay data - session time, details of your in-app

      the device level through your settings or by going to the settings for the app itself.<br> <br>* Advertising ID
      means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are

      no extra costs for the Users. The data we collect help us keep this model while offering you adds that are better
